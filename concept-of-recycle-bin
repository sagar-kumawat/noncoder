# Concept of Recycle bin


For a delete operation, most Operating systems will just mark the file as deleted, but not remove data from the hard drive. This allows for a fast delete.

Actual operation in case of delete depends on the Operating system.
In case of fast delete, the file is not going anywhere. 


For security purposes, most Operating systems also provide option for secure delete which writes combination of zeros and ones to each hard drive sector belonging to file.
Secure delete takes much more time compared to normal delete opration.
