# Reason of missing dates of September 1752 Calender


Reason behind the missing dates in 1752 calender because in 1752 Britain decided to abandon the 
Julian calendar in favour of the Gregorian. By doing so, 3 September instantly became 
14 September - and as a result, nothing whatsoever happened in British history between 3 and 13 September 1752.


The Gregorian calendar:-

The Gregorian calendar is the one most used nowadays. It is named after Pope Gregory Xlll who introduced it in 1582. 
There is a leap year every four years (or more precisely, 97 leap years every 400 years). This means that the year 
corresponds closely with the astronomical year (365.24219 days) so that it is just one day out every 3,300 years.


The Julian Calendar:-

Up until 1753, the calendar we used in Britain was the Julian Calendar. It was 365.25 days long, which was fractionally 
too long, and the calendar over time fell out of line with the seasons and thus was less accurate than the Gregorian Calendar.
